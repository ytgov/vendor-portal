# Top-Level Bin Directory

## `dev` Command

The `dev` command is a helper for using docker compose.

For example, you can run a sql script via

```bash
dev sqlcmd -i ./data/funding_submission_lines.sql
```

assuming the file is located at `/db/data/funding_submission_lines.sql`

Note that the `dev` command uses the `db` service, and so only has access to folders under the top-level `db` directory.
